# Sentinel-1 Introduction to Azure Sentinel

Sentinel often requires are a big environment, which makes it difficult to deploy in your test environment. 

Therefore we recommend that you complete the [Cloud-native security operations with Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/security-ops-sentinel/) training.

Also the [Sentinel Ninja training](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/become-a-microsoft-sentinel-ninja-the-complete-level-400/ba-p/1246310) is an awesome place to start your learnings.
