# Identity-3 Conditional Access

## Description

This quest assumes that you already completed the [secure cloud identities](./Identity-2.md) quest.

Now that Constoso implemented the tools and services that enable securing and protecting their the identities in the cloud, they look for a way to enforce these in an effective way. The change management team is concerned that if users would be prompted with an MFA for all access from any devices they use that would highly degrade the user experience for the newly introduced cloud services, especially the access of Microsoft 365 features. However they understand the importance of validating access requests with MFA, especially for administrative access. They need to find a balance that enables protection of credentials when needed, but also minimizes the distruption to the users.
