# infra-basics-17

## Description

The customer is asking that all the services are using private endpoints. As a first service, you are asked to create a storage account with a ppt(can be uploaded manualy) in a blob container and show how the connection works.

If you are looking to understand more about the network setup look [here](../Networking/infra-networking-1.md)

## Outcome

- Design the solutions
- Deploy the VM solution and have seperate file for the storage account solution.
- Make sure the file is not accessable over a public network.
